The objective of <b>{{ site.name }}</b> is to encourage the exchange of ideas among rust developers, who each possess a unique set of skills and expertise, through virtual collaboration. We explore an extensive range of concepts here. It strives to be your first stop for information that is not only easier to understand but also covers all the ground you’ll need to fully grasp the concepts being presented.

<b>Rust</b> is a great choice when performance matters and it solves pain points that bother many other languages. For the eighth year in a row, Rust has topped the chart as “the most desired programming language” in [Stack Overflow’s annual developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages){:target="_blank"}, implying that many people who have had the chance to use it have fallen in love with it. The Rust community continues to grow.

Feel free to get in [touch]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) with us if you like reading our posts, have feedback for us, or would like to contribute.
 
Happy learning!
